    for the Delete Folders Recursively preference.  This will enable the recursive delete preference.

    <heading>Working with the Clipboard</heading>
    <para>
    Once you copy or cut a file or directory, it is placed in the clipboard.  You can view the contents of the clipboard by clicking
    on the clipboard icon, which is located above the directory/folder listing and to the right of the refresh icon.  This icon is not
    present unless there are items in the clipboard.  Items that are cut or copied will not have a checkbox to the left of them, which
    means they are in the clipboard.  Once you click on the clipboard viewer, you will see a list of items that you have copied or cut.
    From the clipboard viewer, you can paste these items to the current directory, which is displayed above the list of items.
    Simply check the items that you want to paste, then click paste.  These items will be pasted into the current directory and be removed
    from the clipboard.  You will be returned to the current directory after the paste is complete.  If you would like to remove an item
    from the clipboard, simply check the items and click clear.  These items will then be removed from the clipboard and you will be returned
    to the current directory.
