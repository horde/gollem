This document contains instructions for installing the Gollem File Manager on
your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Gollem, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Gollem distribution.


Obtaining Gollem
================

Gollem can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/gollem/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/gollem/

Or use the mirror closest to you:

   http://www.horde.org/mirrors.php

Bleeding-edge development versions of Gollem are available via CVS; see the
file `horde/docs/HACKING`_ in the Horde distribution, or the website
http://www.horde.org/source/, for information on accessing the Horde CVS
repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Gollem **REQUIRES** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Gollem runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for Web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   before installing Gollem.

   .. Important:: Gollem 2 requires version 4 of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   Many of Gollem's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Gollem.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/


2. The following PHP capabilities:

   a. FTP support (--with-ftp) [OPTIONAL]

      If using the FTP VFS driver, the FTP PHP module is **required**.

   b. SQL support [OPTIONAL]

      If using an SQL VFS driver, then SQL PHP support is **required**. For
      further information on how to set up SQL support in Horde, please
      reference the Horde installation document (`horde/docs/INSTALL`_).

3. If using a FTP backend, you **must** have at least one FTP server.
   If using a SQL backend, you **must** have at least one SQL server.

4. If the ability to browse files using WebDAV is desired, the
   HTTP_WebDAV_Server PEAR module is required.

   To install, enter the following at the command prompt::

       pear install HTTP_WebDAV_Server


Installing Gollem
=================

Gollem is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible directory.
The precise location of this directory will differ from system to system.
Conventionally, Gollem is installed directly underneath Horde in the web
server's document tree.

Since Gollem is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply
expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root
directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL.  For
example, with the Apache web server's default document root of
``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/gollem-1.0.tar.gz
   mv gollem-1.0 gollem

and would then find Gollem at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/gollem/


Configuring Gollem
==================

1. Configuring Horde for Gollem

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the ``applications['gollem']``
      stanza.  The default settings here should be okay, but you can change
      them if desired.  If you have changed the location of Gollem relative to
      Horde, either in the URL, in the filesystem or both, you must update the
      ``fileroot`` and ``webroot`` settings to their correct values.

2. Configuring Gollem

   To configure Gollem, change to the ``config/`` directory of the installed
   distribution, and copy the ``backends.php.dist`` configuration file to
   ``backends.php`` and edit it to your needs. You must be sure to configure an
   appropriate backend in ``backends.php``.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the configuration files in the
   ``config/`` directory can be found in each file.  You may edit these files
   if you wish to customize Gollem's appearance and behavior.  The defaults
   will be correct for most sites.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Gollem.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get
   to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to
   get the configuration page.  Select ``File Manager`` from the selection
   list of applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as
   needed.  When done click on ``Generate File Manager Configuration`` to
   generate Gollem configuration directory or file, it will not be able to
   write the file.  In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and choose one
   of the other methods to create the configuration file
   ``gollem/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: Gollem uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the po/ directory.  If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or
   if you're having trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.

3. Securing Gollem

   Review the guidelines for security contained in `horde/docs/SECURITY`_.

4. Tuning Gollem (Performance)

   See `horde/docs/PERFORMANCE`_.
