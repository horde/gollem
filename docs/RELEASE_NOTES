The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Gollem File
Manager version H5 (3.0.12).

Gollem is a web-based file manager, providing the ability to fully manage a
hierarchical file system stored in a variety of backends such as a SQL
database, as part of a real filesystem, or on FTP, Samba or SSH servers. For
more information on Gollem, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/gollem.

For upgrading instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/gollem/docs/UPGRADING

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/gollem/docs/INSTALL

Thanks to Tim O'Driscoll <tim.odriscoll@lambrookschool.co.uk> for reporting the
missing authorization check for file downloads on backends that don't require
implicit authentication.

The major changes compared to Gollem version H5 (3.0.11) are:
    * Fixed unauthorized access to file downloads.
    * Officially support PHP 7.
