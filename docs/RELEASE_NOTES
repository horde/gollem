The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first alpha release of the Gollem
File Manager version H3 (1.1).

Gollem is a web-based file manager, providing the ability to fully manage a
hierarchical file system stored in a variety of backends such as a SQL
database, as part of a real filesystem, an FTP server, or an SSH2 server.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems.  This
version is considered feature complete but there might still be a few bugs.
You should not use this preview version over existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the final release.

Gollem version H3 (1.1) is a major upgrade in the 1.x release series,
including these enhancements:
    * Improved templating of output code to ease local customization.
    * Javascript code now uses the prototype js library, resulting in more
      robust code and more available functionality - for example, sortable
      tables.
    * Editing of text files in the browser.
    * Browse API to allow browsing backends through WebDAV.
    * And much more.

Note that several of these new features require Horde 3.2+.
